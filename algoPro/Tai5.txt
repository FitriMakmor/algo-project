    Growth was better than forecast due to stronger investment, exports and private consumption, an official of the statistics office said after releasing the data
    Investment by chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other companies bringing money home helped the increase, statistics official Huang Wiejie said, adding that he expects steady growth this year for the same reasons
    Although the trade war between China and the U.S. has damaged demand across Asia, it also benefited Taiwan, as some companies increased production in the island economy, or raised exports as a way of avoiding tariffs
