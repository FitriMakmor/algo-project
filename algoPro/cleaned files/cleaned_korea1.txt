Recently I chance dine Seoul senior executive long career global banking. based Thailand recently Hong Kong, watched grow major regional financial center.

In view frequent demonstrations Hong Kong disrupted business times, asked natural question, isnt Seoul running become rival financial hub, given Hong Kongs current problems?

That great question, I told actually efforts Korea government financial sectorrelated groups promote Seoul regional financial center.  fact business visitors often impressed favorably Seouls business infrastructure, including high speed wifi widely available everywhere Korea, modern office buildings, highly educated workforce and, top pluses, modern awardwinning airport number top tier hotels major hotel groups represented

But little progress towards goal. that, given all physical support facilities talented financial workers Seoul? kept Seoul becoming regional financial hub?

The answer I say difficulty foreign financial companies encounter operating Koreas highly bureaucratic regulatory system.

To illustrate visiting exec I recalled foreign asset management company said several years ago companys experience. explained firm managed equivalent $4 billion Korea $40 billion Japan. Korea, said, needed file 4,000 reports government  Japan, portfolio 10 times managed Korea, file 1,000 reports. point making Korean system requires cost foreign companies, even earnings modest.

Others different theories. January 2427 edition Korea Times carried article headlined, Koreas financial hub vision becomes elusive. suggested attempt Korea become financial hub hampered management risks associated rigid labor rules antibusiness sentiment.

But things obviously arent positive elements prompt foreign executives want open office Seoul, seem primary factor preventing Korea attracting foreign financial companies.

As I see it, prevented Korea enticing foreign financials participate Korean market really quite simple increasingly difficult achieve reasonable return investment committed Korea.

Increasingly see major foreign participants  US insurance company,Prudential Life  putting local Korean subsidiaries sale can exit market. cost operating business Korea simply growing far greater pace income growth many foreign financials Korea years. Far luring newcomers enter Korean market, woes prompted others seek opportunities Asian markets.

One thing often said Korean banking sector operates closely supervised utility. financial executives mean make comment cost adhering guidelines Korean financial regulators high yields assets quite low, opportunities enhance returns feebased financial services rather traditional lending limited.

For years Korean banks declining net interest margins despite fact European US standards, Korean interest rates positive expected remain so. revenue growth opportunity Korean finance limited, really limited outlook earnings growth hampers Koreas ability attract foreign financials market.

Only positive changes way Korean government regulates financial sector enable foreign companies look favorably invitations enter Korean market. I overly hopeful happen near term. Korea shown can make rapid changes necessary, creation financial hub Seoul doesnt seem like priority now. least perspective three decades Korean market experience.

A difficult market become even challenging.
