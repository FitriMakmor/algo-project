[SEOUL] South Koreas central bank kept its key interest rate unchanged on Thursday, defying expectations for a cut amid growing pressure to ease policy as the coronavirus hits demand in the exportreliant economy.

The Bank of Koreas Monetary Policy Board held the benchmark interest rate at 1.25 per cent, in contrast to a Reuters poll that expected a quarter percentage point cut.

Only 10 out of 26 economists saw the bank standing pat this week. The other 16 predicted the bank to cut to an alltime low and for a third time.

Governor Lee Ju Yeol holds a news conference at 0220 GMT that is expected to be livestreamed via YouTube to limit crowds and contain the spread of the coronavirus.
