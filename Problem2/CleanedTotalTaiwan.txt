As Taiwanbased manufacturer collaborative robots  machines designed work people  Techman provided 100 robots Quanta production line. shows another common vital factor return Taiwans manufacturers: need use robots replace
human labour.

It impossible labour intensive manufacturers exist Taiwan small population, Huang said. course, can import labourers Southeast Asian countries, can shortterm solution. longterm perspective, manufacturers must adopt largescale automation.


As case many developed countries, young people Taiwan reluctant work factories, making difficult staff production lines. Furthermore, compared manufacturing hubs Asia, Taiwanese workers expensive.

There prerequisites government plan, many people fail realise. entitled government incentives, repatriating companies must invested mainland least two years must affected USChina trade war, must intelligent manufacturing technologies
, Ma added.

The government Tsai Ingwen loudly trumpeting stream Taiwanese companies coming home. December 27, MOEA claimed approved investment applications 165 enterprises worth NT$ 712.1 billion, creating 58,918 new jobs.

However, Tsais exuberance questioned Kuomintang (KMT), Taiwans major opposition party, regarded primary proChina force island politics, claimed ruling Democratic Progressive Party exaggerated trend.

As such, repatriation become hot topic debate Taiwans two main political parties ahead Saturdays presidential election. Caught Beijing Taipei, repatriating manufacturers cautious say, since many still maintain facilities China.

At MOEA meeting last year, former government official Chiou Jiunnrong shown long list Taiwanese firms wishing repatriate, asked names disclosed publicly. Taiwanese companies concerns still facilities China, said former deputy minister Taiwans National Development Council, policyplanning agency.
Rising costs China led small number manufacturers returning Taiwan starting 2015, trend really gathered momentum trade war

It also marks reversal longterm trend Taiwanese producers  like around world  capitalised Chinas manufacturing conditions become globally competitive.

From initial wave investment 1990s, influx Taiwanese companies China peaked 2010, total investment US$ 14.6 billion.
Quanta, provides assembly services clients like Dell, Sony Lenovo, began relocating manufacturing facilities mainland 2000, developing three manufacturing cities

At peak 2006, Shanghai manufacturing compound employed 30,000 workers, officially recognised Chinas second largest exporter 2005 Ministry Commerce.

But Quantas luck mainland ran 2008, global financial crisis hit Chinese exports, shrinking labour force rising wages led rising employment costs.

The company also created problems. 2014, China Labour Watch reported multiple cases misconduct Shanghai plant, including compulsory overtime, insulting management workers. Hundreds workers went strike plant next year, Shanghai authorities began view lowend manufacturing jobs liability rather strength.

The trade war came time rising costs administrative issues China already causing many Taiwanese companies like Quanta look elsewhere.

Notwithstanding U.S.China trade negotiation reached new positive sign, intellectual property rights, technological competition, trade structure issues remain tough resolve properly short term. addition, since US economy entered cyclical slowdown, China reforming economy structure risks exposed municipal debts lingers, international political economic situation still considered grim, may cause corporate holding back investment undermine consumer confidence. manufacturing PMI returned expansion trajectory, decline export ders gradually shrunk, domestic economy likely rebound moderately. Nonetheless, effectiveness returning businesses, whether private investment continue progressively, government’s efforts advancing critical forwardlooking projects, facilitation industrial development transformation upgrading key supports Taiwan’s economic growth momentum. Given aforementioned factors bearing prediction errors, 50% interval forecast GDP growth 2020 range 1.47% 3.81%.
